# Handwritten Equation Solver

This system interprets and solves first-degree equations and inequalities from handwritten text using image processing, machine learning models, and computational algorithms.

## Overview üîÆ

The system recognizes handwritten equations or inequalities, parses them into algebraic expressions, and solves them using Reverse Polish Notation (RPN). It also generates graphical representations of the equations and their solutions.

## How It Works üß†

### 1. Image Processing & Character Segmentation
- The input image is processed to split individual characters using blank spaces or image contours.

### 2. Text Recognition Using ML Model
- A **RandomForestClassifier** trained on the **MNIST** dataset transcribes the segmented characters into text. Over time, the model can be improved by manually correcting outputs, allowing retraining with corrected data for better accuracy.

### 3. Equation Parsing
> Due to lack of dataset, I used `w` as the variable, `//` as `<`, and `///` as `>`
- The recognized text is parsed into an algebraic equation or inequality, such as `6w + 1 // 3` -> `6x + 1 < 3`.

### 4. Solving Using Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)
- The equation is solved using the **Reverse Polish Notation** (RPN) algorithm, which eliminates the need for parentheses and operator precedence.

### 5. Solution Output & Graphical Representation
- The solution is returned with steps, and if applicable, a graph of the equation is generated to visually represent the solution.
